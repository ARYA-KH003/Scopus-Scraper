# Scopus_database
Scopus Scraper : Scopus is an abstract and citation database very used in research.
It provides open sources APIs (https://dev.elsevier.com) to query the database.
This Python code is a Scopus Scraper application that retrieves and presents information about a researcher based on their author ID.
The user inputs the author ID, and the code sends API requests to Scopus to gather data such as the author's name, affiliation, document count, and more.
It also allows the user to input a document ID to fetch and display detailed information about a specific document.
The code is well-commented to explain its functionality and handles various exceptions to ensure robustness. 
It utilizes Scopus APIs and the user's API key for data retrieval.
